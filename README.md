Appeal

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lets Begin:
Ambition:
Appeal
Player Accountability 
	You are accountable for your account's actions. If someone else has access to your account, even accidental access, and uses it to break server rules, we will still take action against your account. If, for instance, a sibling of yours uses the account to grief our server, you will still be held accountable for that grief.

	If people that you do not trust have access to the computer you use to play, we suggest disabling the "remember my password" option on your Minecraft client and internet browser. Thank you.

	And for staff, any players unbanned or ruled innocent, will become your responsibility and their actions will reflect upon you.

Type of Appeal:
Ban

Minecraft IGN:
Daedalus_MC

Date/Time punishment was issued:
June 8, 2014, 7:50 PM (Pacific Time)

Who issued the punishment:
BigBelly

Punishment Reason:
Hacked Client

Why do you think we should lift the punishment for you:
	I apologize the (and accept all responsibility) of the fact that I was playing with a hacked client.  I understand that it was an incredibly stupid thing to do, especially after widespread realization.   I also accept the fact that what I did was wholly unacceptable, and should not have even started to happen.
	I believe that I should be unbanned because I have helped the server through issues and problems:
Finding and understanding the duping machines of The_Dark_Fubar, Crabby, etc, along with helping provide eye witness accounts of how it started, and when.  
Helping out Rocket and Tim finding and jailing X-Ray”ers”, thieves, and greifers.  
Brian with testing of the upcoming plugin, StickyLocks, and making sure it is compatible with the bukkit plugins we currently use.
	
	For these reasons, I bleeive that I have proved myself to be a trustworthy person, and that when I say I will not hack again, that means I will.  Through my past actions, I have proved that I have the servers best interests at heart, and that though I screwed up this time, I will not again.
