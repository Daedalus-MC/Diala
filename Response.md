Reponse

I did not at all say that I did not do anything wrong to Brax, I wholeheartedly admitted to using it, past when I got warned not to.  I said to her when she asked how I got banned that I was using a hacked client, even through being warned not to.  I said that I annoyed you, which most likely triggered you, however I prefaced it with the fact that I used it, and reiterated it at the end  ( I think what I said that got misinterpreted was that I was not using the hacks at the time of banning, however I had multiple times since being warned not to).  She even recorded it...  Also, when I got unbanned through a glitch in UUID's, the first, last, and only things I said were (in this order):
I am banned, I should not be allowed on.  After this, Brian and I checked if the correct  UUID was banned, and once we figured out that it was, I asked if he could try banning again, and seeing if that worked.  It did, and that was the end of that ordeal.  

I do not believe myself to be above the rules, or better than anyone else.  I got told initially to try the hacked client by staff (Rocket told me to try it, for ease of use stuff such as the auto clicker and fast place, along with fast flight and speed).  I also made sure to severely cut down on usage of the hacked client after being warned not to, and rarely used anything other than the auto clicker (I stopped using it in capture the flag other than to show Kaos one thing, which he was curious about, and I used the sneak feature that allows you to sneak without holding down the key, as I smashed my pinkie with a hammer while working on my scooter, in real life). A whole lot of what was misconstrued as hacking was Kaos disliking the fact that I managed to kill him, and then screaming in global chat about me using a hacked client.  
I do realize that I shouldn’t have used it, even with the nonchalance that staff showed towards it (Zilla said once that I shouldn’t use it, with a sarcastic tone, Daniiiiii kicked me, and didn’t say anything past then, and I got told by rocket to use it.)  I do take responsibility for my actions, and I hope to have cleared up any confusion with this.

Thank-you,

Robert A. Cousineau
